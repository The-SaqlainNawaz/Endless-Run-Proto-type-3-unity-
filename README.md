##Description
In this Unit, you will program a fast-paced endless side-scrolling runner game where the player needs to time jumps over oncoming obstacles to avoid crashing. In creating this prototype, you will learn how to add music and sound effects, completely transforming the experience of your projects. You will also learn how to create dynamic, endlessly repeating backgrounds, which are critical for any side-scrolling game. Finally, you will learn to incorporate particle effects like splatters and explosions, which make your games so much more satisfying to play.
